This project marks Day 01 of my 30-day Python coding challenge, where I aim to strengthen my Python programming skills by practicing daily coding exercises.

On this day, I focused on Python fundamentals, including variables, data types, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, conditional statements, loops, functions, and recursion. The goal is to cover essential Python concepts while also practicing problem-solving with small algorithms.

Theory Covered – Day 01
1. Printing & Variables

print() is used to display output.

Variables store data like integers, strings, or floats:

age = 23
name = "Ahmed"

2. Data Types

String: Sequence of characters "Hello"

Integer: Whole numbers 23

Float: Decimal numbers 44.5

List: Ordered collection [1, 2, 3]

Tuple: Immutable ordered collection (1, 2, 3)

Dictionary: Key-value pairs {"Name":"Ahmed", "Age":23}

Set: Unordered collection of unique elements {1,2,3}

3. String Operations

Indexing: name[1:4] → Access substring

Methods: .lower(), .count(), len()

4. List, Tuple, and Dictionary Operations

Access elements by index: list[1], tuple[3]

Nested dictionaries: DICT["Subjects"]["PHY"]

Methods like .items(), .keys() for dictionaries

5. Set Operations

union(), intersection(), pop()

Sets automatically remove duplicates

6. Input & Type Conversion

input() receives user input as a string

Convert with int(), float() as needed

7. Conditional Statements

if, else to perform decisions:

if age > 18:
    print("Can Drive")
else:
    print("Cannot Drive")

8. Loops

While Loop: Repeats while condition is True

For Loop: Iterates over a list or set

9. Functions

Functions allow code reuse:

def Driving(age):
    if age > 18:
        return "You can drive"
    else:
        return "You cannot drive"

10. Recursion

Function calling itself to solve problems:

Power calculation: x^n

Count occurrences in a list

Check palindrome

Factorial

11. Algorithms Practiced

Prime number check

Vowel and consonant count

Max & Min of three numbers

Sum & product of list numbers

Palindrome check for string/list
